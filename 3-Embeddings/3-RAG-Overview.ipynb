    "### Retrival Augmentented Generation\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts.\n"

         "Approaches to developing largescale superconducting quantum processors must cope with the numerous microscopic degrees of freedom that are ubiquitous in solidstate devices Stateoftheart superconducting qubits employ aluminium oxide AlOx tunnel Josephson junctions as the sources of nonlinearity necessary to perform quantum operations Analyses of these junctions typically assume an idealized purely sinusoidal currentphase relation However this relation is expected to hold only in the limit of vanishingly lowtransparency channels in the AlOx barrier Here we show that the standard currentphase relation fails to accurately describe the energy spectra of transmon artificial atoms across various samples and laboratories Instead a mesoscopic model of tunnelling through an inhomogeneous AlOx barrier predicts percentlevel contributions from higher Josephson harmonics By including these in the transmon Hamiltonian we obtain orders of magnitude better agreement between the computed and measured energy spectra The presence and impact of Josephson harmonics has important implications for developing AlOxbased quantum technologies including quantum computers and parametric amplifiers As an example we show that engineered Josephson harmonics can reduce the charge dispersion and associated errors in transmon qubits by an order of magnitude while preserving their anharmonicity The standard currentphase relation in tunnel Josephson junctions involves a single sinusoidal term but real junctions are more complicated The effects of higher Josephson harmonics have now been identified in superconducting qubit devices",

         "Approaches to developing largescale superconducting quantum processors must cope with the numerous microscopic degrees of freedom that are ubiquitous in solidstate devices Stateoftheart superconducting qubits employ aluminium oxide AlOx tunnel Josephson junctions as the sources of nonlinearity necessary to perform quantum operations Analyses of these junctions typically assume an idealized purely sinusoidal currentphase relation However this relation is expected to hold only in the limit of vanishingly lowtransparency channels in the AlOx barrier Here we show that the standard currentphase relation fails to accurately describe the energy spectra of transmon artificial atoms across various samples and laboratories Instead a mesoscopic model of tunnelling through an inhomogeneous AlOx barrier predicts percentlevel contributions from higher Josephson harmonics By including these in the transmon Hamiltonian we obtain orders of magnitude better agreement between the computed and measured energy spectra The presence and impact of Josephson harmonics has important implications for developing AlOxbased quantum technologies including quantum computers and parametric amplifiers As an example we show that engineered Josephson harmonics can reduce the charge dispersion and associated errors in transmon qubits by an order of magnitude while preserving their anharmonicity The standard currentphase relation in tunnel Josephson junctions involves a single sinusoidal term but real junctions are more complicated The effects of higher Josephson harmonics have now been identified in superconducting qubit devices",
