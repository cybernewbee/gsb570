Dog:
Taking care of a dog for a week involves consistency, attention, and lots of affection. Dogs are creatures of habit, and maintaining a steady routine helps them feel secure and relaxed. Begin each morning between 6:30 and 8:00 AM with a cheerful greeting. Allow the dog to wake up gradually, offering gentle pets and an upbeat tone to start the day on a positive note. Once the dog is alert and ready, take them outside for their first potty break. Whether on a leash or in a fenced yard, be sure to stay with them until they’ve had a chance to relieve themselves. Offer praise after they go — simple words like “good potty” reinforce good behavior.

After their bathroom break, it’s time for breakfast. Measure out the appropriate portion of their usual food — typically dry kibble, but this might include wet food or nutritional toppers depending on the dog's diet. Any supplements or medications that are part of their morning routine should be added at this time, either mixed into food or offered separately if the dog is trained to take pills. Ensure the water bowl is rinsed and filled with fresh, cool water. After feeding, allow 10 to 20 minutes of light activity. This could include a walk, a game of fetch, or tug-of-war. If time is limited, even supervised sniffing in the yard helps burn energy. Don’t forget to pick up any waste and dispose of it in the designated trash can or compost, if applicable.

If you’ll be away from home for several hours, a midday potty break is ideal, typically between 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM. This gives the dog a chance to relieve themselves and get some mental stimulation. A short walk or just backyard time can go a long way. For enrichment, consider leaving a puzzle toy or a treat-filled KONG. Rotating toys daily helps prevent boredom. Be sure to check the water bowl again at this time and refresh if needed — it should always be clean, free of hair, debris, or leftover food.

Evening routines should begin between 5:00 and 7:00 PM. Start with dinner, offering the same quantity and type of food as the morning meal. Some dogs also take medication in the evening, so administer anything prescribed according to the owner’s instructions. After feeding, take the dog on a longer walk or play with them in the yard. A 20- to 30-minute walk is not only good exercise but helps regulate digestion and provides a chance for sniffing and exploring. Again, always clean up after the dog and note any unusual waste — it’s a good indicator of their health. Evening is also a great time for a brief training session. Spend 5 to 10 minutes reviewing basic commands like “sit,” “stay,” “down,” and “come.” Keep sessions positive and reward-based, using treats or enthusiastic praise.

As bedtime approaches, usually between 8:30 and 10:00 PM, offer one last potty break. This final outing ensures the dog is comfortable and won’t wake you up in the middle of the night needing to go outside. Once they’re done, begin winding down for the night. Turn off bright lights and reduce noise levels. Offer cuddles, gentle petting, or allow the dog to chew on a calm toy if they like something to settle with. Guide them to their bed or crate, depending on where they’re used to sleeping. Make sure their sleeping space is clean, soft, and located in a quiet part of the house.

Throughout the day, it's important to follow the dog's usual walking preferences. Use the leash and harness they are familiar with, and take the routes they are comfortable with — preferably quiet streets or parks. Be aware of any reactive behaviors like barking at other dogs or lunging at moving objects. Common cues you may need include “leave it,” “heel,” and “wait.” Consistency with commands keeps the dog responsive and builds trust.

For feeding, be sure to use the same brand and formulation of food the dog is used to. Their feeding portions should not vary unless directed otherwise by the owner. Treats can be used for training and affection, but keep them limited — overfeeding treats can cause digestive upset. The water bowl should be dumped, rinsed, and refilled at least twice daily to ensure it's always fresh.

Enrichment is just as important as food and exercise. Keep a rotation of toys available. Dogs often love stuffed animals, ropes, tennis balls, and chew toys. Puzzle feeders and KONGs stuffed with peanut butter, yogurt, or kibble can keep them entertained while you’re out. Be sure to supervise any chewable toys or bones to avoid choking hazards or splintering.

Grooming depends on the dog’s breed and coat. Daily brushing may be necessary for longer-haired dogs, while short-haired breeds may only need a brush once or twice a week. Use the preferred brush and focus on trouble areas like behind the ears and under the legs. Wipe paws if muddy, and only bathe the dog if absolutely necessary — using dog-safe shampoo and ensuring they are thoroughly dried. You may also be asked to clean ears or trim nails, but only do this if you're comfortable and experienced. Otherwise, leave those tasks to the owner or a groomer.

Health is always a top priority. If the dog is on medications, follow instructions exactly — including dosage, time of day, and method of delivery (for example, wrapped in cheese or hidden in peanut butter). Monitor the dog’s appetite, energy levels, stool consistency, and any signs of distress such as vomiting, diarrhea, limping, or unusual licking. If something seems off, don’t hesitate to contact the vet. The owner should provide both a primary vet’s contact information and a backup emergency vet that is open 24/7.

Understanding the dog’s social temperament is also key. Some dogs are friendly with all people and animals, while others are more reserved or reactive. Know if the dog is good with children, other dogs, or cats. Only allow off-leash time in secure, fenced-in areas unless you’re explicitly told otherwise. Be aware of their comfort zones and avoid stressful triggers like crowded sidewalks or loud construction sites.

Follow any house rules the owner sets. Is the dog allowed on the couch or bed? Are there areas of the house that are off-limits? Use the same boundaries and rules to help avoid confusing the dog. If you need to correct a behavior, avoid yelling. Instead, redirect the dog calmly or use cues like “uh-uh” or “leave it,” followed by praise when they listen. Consistency and patience go a long way in maintaining a respectful relationship.

Lastly, check in with the owner regularly. Let them know how their dog is doing with a quick message or photo update. It shows you care and keeps them reassured while they're away. If supplies like food or poop bags are running low, make a note or let the owner know ahead of time. At the end of the week, you’ll have made a new furry friend — and maybe their human too!

Taking care of a hot tub for a week while the owner is away requires a bit of attention to detail, but it’s not difficult once you get into a rhythm. The main goals are to keep the water clean, safe, and balanced; ensure all components are running smoothly; and maintain general cleanliness of the tub area. With just 10 to 15 minutes of care each day, you’ll keep everything in top shape until I return.

Each day, take a moment to check the water level. The water should stay just above the jets and below the headrests. If the water is too low, it can cause the pump to run dry, which can damage the system. If it looks a little low — especially if it's been hot or windy — use a garden hose to top it off. Always add water before checking or adjusting chemicals, since water volume affects chemical balance.

Next, check the water temperature on the control panel. It should read between 98°F and 104°F, depending on how I’ve set it (I typically keep it around [insert temperature preference if known]). If the temperature is too low, it may just need time to recover after the cover was off. But if it’s consistently dropping or not heating at all, that could indicate a pump or heater issue — in that case, please contact me right away.

Once the basics are in check, move on to chemical maintenance, which is the most important task for keeping the water clean and safe. I use a chlorine (or bromine, specify which) sanitizer system, so daily or every-other-day checks are essential. Use the provided test strips — just dip one in the water for 2 seconds and compare it to the color chart on the bottle. The key things to look for are sanitizer level, pH, and alkalinity. Ideal chlorine levels should be between 1 and 3 ppm (bromine: 3–5 ppm), pH should be in the 7.2 to 7.8 range, and total alkalinity between 80 and 120 ppm.

If sanitizer levels are low, add a small amount of chlorine granules (usually 1–2 teaspoons). If pH is low, use pH increaser; if it’s high, add pH decreaser — both are clearly labeled. Stir the water with a clean cup or just run the jets for a few minutes to circulate any added chemicals. There’s also a shock treatment (oxidizer) that should be added once during the week, ideally on day three or four. Just pour the pre-measured amount in while the jets are running and leave the cover off for 15–20 minutes afterward to let the gasses escape.

Speaking of the cover — please make sure it stays securely closed when not in use. This keeps heat in and debris out. If it rains or gets windy, check that it's snug and not sagging or collecting water. You can use the lift bar to open and close it carefully to avoid damage. If water pools on top after a storm, gently tip it to drain or use a broom to push it off. Avoid placing anything heavy on the cover.

Every couple of days, give the filter a quick rinse. The filter housing is typically located under the skimmer flap. Turn off the power temporarily using the control panel or breaker, remove the filter, and rinse it with a garden hose. A thorough spray from all sides helps remove hair, oils, and dirt. Shake off excess water and reinstall before turning the system back on. No need for deep cleaning unless the water looks cloudy or flow seems reduced.

Also, keep the hot tub area tidy. If leaves, bugs, or debris fall into the water, skim them out using the net provided. Wipe down the rim of the hot tub with a clean cloth to keep it from building up oils or dirt. Don’t use household cleaners on the shell — only use hot tub-safe products if needed (though routine wiping should be fine).

In the unlikely event that you hear strange noises, see error messages on the control panel, or notice water leaks, please let me know immediately. Most minor alerts resolve on their own (like “FLO” for a momentary low flow), but I’d rather be safe than sorry. You can also consult the laminated troubleshooting guide in the equipment cabinet if needed.

Lastly, for safety: don’t enter the tub unless we’ve talked about it beforehand — it’s being maintained, not actively used. If anyone does end up in the water, it’s critical to shock the tub afterward and check the chemicals again. Also, keep the electrical panel and any cords dry, and don’t plug in any new electronics around the hot tub.
